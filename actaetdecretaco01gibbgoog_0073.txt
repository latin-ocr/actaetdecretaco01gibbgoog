take eourage and be valiant. . . Behold I command thee, take
eourage aud be strong. Fear not and be not dismayed, beon& the
Lord thy God is with thee'’ (dosue i., 6, 7, 8, 9). The latter clause
gives the reason why we should take oourage and be strong. An
intermediate verse gives the means of seeuring God’s assistance:
“ Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth, but thou shalt
meditate on it day and night, that thou mayest observa and do the
things that aro written in it.” Keep, then, day and night, before
your eyes the Law of God and His teaohings through that Holy
Chareh that He has appointed mother and mistress of all men. Fly
tho reading of all infidel books, aud keep them from your children,
as you would the poison of asp or basilisk. Teaeh them that you
and they, in listening to Holy Chureh, havethe guidanee of Him
who said, “I arn the way, the truth and the life.'' Let others doubt
or deny, but with the Apostle, you know whom you have believed,
and you are oertain that He will make good the trust you have
repursdl in Him (ΙΙ. Tim. i., 12).

‘ Christ our Lord oommissioned His Apostles to teaeh mankind the
truths they had been taught by Him. They rooeived no oommand-
ment to write on any doctrine, mueh less to draw up a body of
articles of saith sueh as our ehildren now learn from the mteehhm.
They preaehed and taught by word of mouth3 or, when oenasion
offered itself, they tiroto astho Divina Spirit prompted them. What
they wrote and what they delivered by oral instruction are equally
God's Word. And this two-sold Word, written and unwritten, is
the Deposit of divine truth, eornrnitted to the keeping of the Catholie
Clnrreh, and ehiefly to him on whom the Chureh was built-the only
Apnistle who, in the tull sense of the words, yet lives and rules iu tho
personet his sufflssors, and who, from his unfailing ehair, imp‘nts
to all who sealt it tho truth of Christian saith (ste Epist. S. Petri
Chrysologi inter Epp. S. Leonis hh). It is his offioe to confirm his
brothmn, and the histiny of the Chureh exhibita hin1‚from the
lnginning and through all ages, as faithfully fulfilling the eharge en-

trustol to hini by his lllaster (Luke xxii, 32). From the earliest ages
down to oureus, the voire of Peter has been foremost in ‹eudemu-
ing all ‹leviations froin apostolia doetrine. No threats of worldly
parer ‹onld saldae or silente that voire. To sin-h thnats Peter,
through his euarestus, has ever given the same auswer that he gave
at Jerusalem to the assembled priests and aneients (hats iu, 19-20).
