as the early Clnistians held firmly to the divinity of the Son and of

the Holy Ghost three hundred years before th'c Chureh found it

noecssary to detine them in the Councils of Nice and Byzantium.
And in our own country, writers and speakers who know the

Chureh only by thc caricatures drawn by prejudiee, have occasion-
ally re-echoed the same charge3 bnt despite local and tempor-ary
excitements, the good sense of the American people has always
prevailed against the mlumny. We think we ean claim to be
acquainted both with the lawe, institutione and spirit of the Catholio
Chureh, and with the lawe, institutions and spirit of our eountry3
and we emphatieally declare that there is no antagonism between
them. A Catholic finds himself at home in the United Statce3 for
the influenoe of his Chureh has constantly been exercised in behalf
of individual rights and popular liberties. And the right—mindcd
American nowhere finds himself more at home than in the Catholic
Chureh, for nowhere else ean he breathe more frecly that atmosphere

We repudiate with equal earnestness the assertion that we need to

xiii.,1); becarrse, therefore, back of the events which led to the
formation of the Republic, she sees the Providence of God leading to
that issue, and back of our eountry’s laws the authority cf God as
their sanctiam—this is evidently so illogical and contradictory an
accusation, that we are astonished to hear it advanced by persons
of ordinary intelligenee: We believe that our eountry's heroes were
the instrumente of the God of Nations in establishing this home of
freel0m3 to both the Almighty and to His instrumente in the work
wc look with grateful reverence3 and to maintain the inheritance of
freedom which they have left us, should it ever-which God forbid-
be imperilled, our Catholic citizens will be found to stand forward as
one man, ready to pledge anew “their lives, their fortunes and their
sacred honor.''

No less illogical would be the notion, that there is aught in the
fiee spirit of our American institutione, incompatible with perfect
docility to thc Chureh of Christ. The spirit of American freedom is
