not one of anarohy or of lioense. It essentially involves love of order,
respeet for rightful authority, and obedienee to just laws. Thereis
nothing in the eharaoter of the most liberty-loviug American, which
could hinder his reverential submission to the Divina authority of

Our Lord, or to the like authority delegated by Him to His Apostles
⁸ aud His Cluuch. Nor are there in the world more devoted adherente

’ of the Catholio Choreb, the See of Peter, and the Vioar of Christ,

thau the Catholies of the United States. Narrow, iusular, national
viows aud jealousies ooneerning eeclesiastiorl authority and Chureh
organizatiou, may have sprung naturally enough from the selfish pol- ·
iey of certain rulers aud natious in by-goue times3 but they find no
sympathy in the spirit of the true American Catholio. His normal
iustinets, uo less than his religious training, would forbid him to
submit iu matters of faith to the dictatiou of the State or to any
merely luuuau authority whatsoever. He arrrepts the religion and the
Chureh that are from God, aud he kuows well that thore are uni-
versal, not national or lond-destined for all the children of men aud
not sor auy speeial tribe or tmrgue. We glory that we are, aud, with
God's hlomiug, shall continue to ho, not the Ameriran Chureh, nor
the Chureh of the Uuitod States, nor a Chureh iu auy other sense
exclusive or limited, hut au integral part of theone, holy, Catholio
aud Apostolie Chareh of J esus Christ, which is the Bady of Christ,
iu which there is uo distinction of classes and nationalit·ies,—in whieh
all ure oue iu J esras Christ (Gal. iii, 28).

While the aasanlts of (alluuuy aud perseeution directed against the
Chureh siuee the Vatiruu Couuoil lravo abundantly shown how angry
the powers of evil liare been at the Couueil's luminous uttorames of
Divino iroth, our Holy Far-her the Pope has heeu, naturally enough,
the maiu ohjeet of attauh. And Divino Providence has been pleased
to lawe him for a while at the morey of his eu‘emieS, iu order that
their impious violence might work out the demonstration of its own
iujusthe3 that the true eharaeter and the indestrmtihility os the office
ol' St. Peter might he made manifest to the world; that the wisdom
of the l‘uwideure which has guarded the indepeudeme of that office
iu the pam, might he vindieated aud reaffirmed for the future. The
great aud laelovod Pius IX. died the “Prisouer of the varirooss' and
Leo Xl ll. has iuherited his Apostolio trials, together with his Apos-
tolio offioe. Day aller day he has seen the amseemted patrimouy of
religion aud eharity swept into Ctoear's auffers by the rathless hand
