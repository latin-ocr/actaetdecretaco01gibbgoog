every side, when every department 11 natural truth and fact is actively
explored 111 objections against revealed religion, it is evident how
extensive and thorough should be the 'knowledge of 1111 minister 11
the Divino Word‚ that he may be able to show forth worthily the
beauty, the superiority, the necessity of the Christian religion, aud to
prove that there is nothing in all that God has made to amtradiet
anythiug that God has taught.

Hence 1111 priest who has the noble ambitiones attaining to the
high level 11 his holy office, may well oonsider himself a student all

but 1111 course of study was osten more rapid aud restricted thau she
desirod. At present our improved circumstances 1111111 11 praetirable
both 11 lengthen aud widcn the course, aud 111 this the Conucil has
duly provided.

We are confident, beloved brethren, that you 1111 as deeply iuter-
ested as ourselves 111 the aeeomplishment of these great results. This
you have hitherto manifested by the zealous liberality by which you
have enabled usto build and support our seminaries3 aud we are
well assurod that you will not be found wanting, should 11111 greater
efforts be necessary, to enable us to make the edumtiou and usesulness
