forgetful and unbelieving world that reason is God's highest and best
gia to man in the natural order, and that this most salntary endow·
ment is not only not impaircd, but strengthened, supplemented and
ennobled by the supernatural gift of Divine revelation. ·

We have no reason 10 sear that you, heloved brothton, arc likely
to be carried away by these or other false doctrines condemned by
the vatican Council, such as materialism or the denial 01 God's
power 10 01301010 reveal to mankind His hidden truths, to display
hy miracles His almighty power 111 this world, which is the work 01
Η13 hands. But neither can we close our eyes 10 the fact, that
toachers 01 skepticism and irreligion are at work in our country.
They have crept into the leading educational institutione 01 our non·
Catholic fellowcitinens ; they have (though rarely) made their appear-
ance in the public prees and even 111 the pulpit. Could we rely fully
on t-he innate good sense of the American people and on that lmbitual

reverence for God and religion which has so far been their just pride ·

and glory, there might seem comparatively little danger 01 the general
diffusion 01 those wild theorics which reject or ignore Revelution‚
undermine morality, and end not unfrcquently by banishing God
from His own creation. But when 111311113111103000111111113(1311)1
signs of growing unbelief‚ and see how its heralds not only scek to
mould the youthful mind in our colleges and scats 01 learning, but
are also actively working arnongst the messes, we cannot but shudder
at the dangers that threaten 113 111 the future. When to 11113 we add
the rapid growth of that 10133 civilization which hides 113 1011111333
11111131 the name of enlightenment-involving, as it does, the undis·
' guised worship 01 mammon, the anxious search aster every ease,
comfort and luxury for man's physical well-being, the all-absorbing
desire to promote his material interests, tho unconcern or rather con-
tempt for those 01 his higher and better nature—we 00111101 but feel
that out of all this must grow that heartless nratcrialism, which is the
best soil 1ο receive the seeds 01 unbelief and irreligion, which threaten

to desolate the country at no distant day. The first thing to perish ‚

will be onr liberties. For men, who know not God or religion, <an

never respect the inalienable rights which man has received froin His
Creator. The State in 3110110130 1111131 become a ‹lcspotism, whether
, 113 power be lodged in the hands of one or of many.

To you, beloved brethren‚ who possess the treasure of Catholic
saith, we may safely address the reiterated injunctions 01 the Lord to
the chosen leoder 01 His people: “ Take courage and bc strong . .
