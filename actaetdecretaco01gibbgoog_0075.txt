revived theold warery raised by the Jews against our Sevionr
(John xix, 12‚15), end so osten renewed by the persecutore of the
Chureh. They pretended thet by defining the infallibility of St
Peter’s suceessor, she had made herself tbe enemy of cesar. Herein
we see plainly verified the strong languuge of Scriptum: “ Iniquity
bath lied to itself '’ (Ps. xxvi, 19). The Pope‚ even nster the pro-
clamation of bis infallibility, is no more the enemy of Ceasar and of
human governments, then was the infallible Peter the enemy of
Nero, or Christ our Lord, who is infallible truth itself, the enemy
of Augustus aud Tiberius, under whom He was born into tbe world,
taught and suffered. The govemments by which, three oenturies
ego, tho new tenete of Lutber, Zwingli and Calvin hnd been imposed
on reluctant peoplm by the sword, were the first, indeed the only ones,
to again unsheothe it against Catholie believerS, and especially against
bisbops aud elergy. It was their purpose to exterminate by degrees
tbe Catholio hierareby, end replaee it by a servile priestbood that

generous vigor and almirable oonstaney, they availed themselves
of every loga] end oorrstitutionel means to eheel( tbe edvenees of
despotism, aud save their own freedom and that of their oountry.
They bave given to tbe world a glorious example, wbieh it is to be
hopod tbe victims of tymnnous Liberalism in Catholio eouutries may
some day have the wisdom or the eourage to imitate. The struggle
has now lasted sourteen years ; but the very friends of tbis perse-
euting legislation bave been driven at last to aekuowlelge tbat it has
proved to be e miserable sailure3 and no better proof of it oould be
souud than the fast that the rulers of Prussia bave had to fall back
on tbe patriotism of the Catholio bsuly to stay the threateniug moreh ·
of soeialism aud revolution. Iu Switzerlaud, too, the purseeution
bas yielded to tbe polioy of mildness and ooneiliation adopted by Onr
Holy Futber, Leo XIII. Ι
Beloved bretbren, we heve no need to enoourage you to bold
