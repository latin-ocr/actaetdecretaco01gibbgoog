No pleading 01 princes and potentates could ever wru Rome’s
sympathy for error3 no heresy under false semblanee of Catholic
truth ever yet eluded her vigilant eye (Cf. St. Cyprian, Ep. lia).
As soon as any novelty appeared, all hearts and eyes were turned
towards the Chair 01 Peter, and when that Chair gave its decision,
Christian people yielded obedience. Those who would not, were cut
off from the communion 01 the Church, and became theneeforth as
the heathen and the publican.

This doctrine, therefore, which had so thoroughly wrought itself
into the life and aetion of the Church, the Vatican Couneil deemed

proper to consecrate by a solemn definition. Hence, that no one in .

future may eraftily pretend not to‘know, how and whence to aseer-
tain what the'Church officially teauhes; above all, that no'one may
heneeforth smtter the haneful seeds of false doctrine with impunity,
under the mask of au appeal from the judgment 01 the Holy See

definition upon what has always been the belief and praetiee of the
Church. Yet “the gates of Hell,'' the powers of darkness that
forever assail the Church built on Peter-though hnowing that they
cannot prevail against it nor make void God’s promise (Matth. xvi,
18)-—seem to have been stirred to the very depths by the 'proclama-
tion 01 this great truth. And their impetent rage has found its echo
upon earth. The definition evoked 0 stcrm 01 fieree obloquy and
reckless vituperation, such as has been seldom witnessed amongst our ‘
opponente. And a wretched handful of apostate Catholics “went
out from us, but they were not of us'’ (1. John ii, 19).

But, what was far more serious, the hings of the earth stood up
and the princes assembled together against the Lord (Acts iv, 26)
and against His anointed Vicar, because 01 the definition. They
